## Original User Request:
An application that allows me to change the voices of a song, that is, I have a track in Spanish of my voice in m4a which will be used to train the model that will run on an Intel i 7 of the 12th generation without a GPU, any song that I put on it should change the voice to mine. Use Demucs to separate the voice of the song that I sent to the app.
